# User guide: cloud controller, worker, and eval

Copy-paste these blocks. Every command has a `#` comment. This page uses placeholders (`CONTROLLER_IP`). This lab’s real IP and SSH: [testing/cloud-eval-runbook.md](testing/cloud-eval-runbook.md).

Two different downloads:

- **mac-k3d CLI** — GitHub asset `mac-k3d-linux-x86_64` (or `linux-aarch64` / `darwin-aarch64` / `darwin-x86_64`). Used in steps 1–2.
- **iCode release** — official `icode-<os>-<arch>-full-vX.Y.Z` from the iCode project. Jenkins **uploads** it on **Build with Parameters**. Local `--stage` / `--local` still uses a worker path or `~/.local/share/mac-k3d/` discover. Not the same file as mac-k3d.

Prefer **v0.5.2** Latest (or this checkout’s `cargo build --release`). **v0.5.1** DeepSWE Pier used the wrong iCode CLI and often exited in ~20s. **v0.5.0** still has the old iCode step: it only accepts a file named `icode` or a `*.tar.gz` / `*.tgz`. An extensionless `icode-…-full-…` download needs v0.5.1+.

Eval jobs cover three benchmarks, all Harbor + iCode + DeepSeek catalog model (default `deepseek-flash`; also `deepseek-v4-pro`). `setup` installs the Harbor version pinned in `pipeline/config/toolchain.env` (0.22.0), and every build's `env` phase checks it again. How each Harbor flag is used: [pipeline.md](pipeline.md#how-harbor-is-called). Release and git mount that iCode the same way and run one `icode run` per rollout with `ICODE_PROVIDER=DeepSeek`, `ICODE_REASONING_EFFORT=high`, `ICODE_API_BASE=https://api.deepseek.com/v1`, `ICODE_MAX_TOKENS=65536` and `ICODE_MAX_ITERATIONS=500` (the iCode developers' eval limits). The Jenkins model choice stays the catalog id. The report labels it `openai/<id>` and records the real provider and reasoning effort under `eval_protocol`.

- **DeepSWE** via **Harbor** (`icode_harbor_agent:ICodeAgent`). Same worker `icode-*-full-*` bind-mount and the same iCode CLI (`run -t … -C … -a code --json`).
- **LoLBench** via **Harbor** (same agent; bind-mounts the same worker drop). Hub `smartdub26/lolbench` tags are arm64-only; on x86_64, the `tasks` phase builds or retags a local image (do not use Harbor `--force-build`).
- **SWE-bench Pro** via **Harbor**. The `tasks` phase writes a task whose image is `jefzda/sweap-images:…`. The verifier scores `FAIL_TO_PASS` / `PASS_TO_PASS` into `reward.json`. Images are 1–3 GB each; first live job should set **one** `TASK` (`instance_id`).

Each benchmark has three job shapes. Start with `_one_task` (one question, one rollout), use `_some_task` for a handful of questions, and `_full_suite_task` for the whole suite — it splits the work across workers and merges the results. Details: [evaluation.md](evaluation.md#which-job-to-run).

Workers do **not** create a `.env` or store the DeepSeek key. The key lives on the **cloud Jenkins** credential `deepseek-api-key`.

The worker wizard has a default Jenkins URL (press Enter to keep it). Type `http://<CONTROLLER_IP>:17070` for your controller. Same-PC controller: `http://localhost:17070`.

---

## What you need

- Cloud Linux VM (`CONTROLLER_IP`) with **root**, ~8 GB RAM, **60 GB** free, security group **17070** open to the worker.
- New Mac or Linux worker, ~8 GB RAM, **40 GB** free, Docker allowed. **sudo** helps; without it, `setup` saves your answers and prints the few commands an administrator must run as root (installing Java/git/Docker, the `docker` group, `loginctl enable-linger`) — see [new-machine.md](new-machine.md#what-root-must-run).
- **mac-k3d CLI** GitHub asset matching the machine (`mac-k3d-linux-x86_64`, `mac-k3d-linux-aarch64`, `mac-k3d-darwin-aarch64`, `mac-k3d-darwin-x86_64`).
- **iCode release** `icode-<os>-<arch>-full-vX.Y.Z` (or a standalone executable named `icode`) to **upload in Jenkins** when you start a release-mode job. For local `--stage` / `--local` only, copy it onto the worker after setup.

Developer checkout + `.env` is optional (appendix). Users run eval through Jenkins.

iCode is an **agent harness**. The job scores iCode with DeepSeek on DeepSWE, LoLBench, or SWE-bench Pro, all through Harbor. Read pass@1, resolved, tokens, and time in `artifact.json` and `report.html`. The agent may reach the DeepSeek API and nothing else (`--allow-agent-host`, from `pipeline/config/network-allowlist-v1.json`).

---

## 1. Create the controller on the cloud

```bash
# SSH to the cloud VM as root (use your IP if it is not this lab)
ssh root@CONTROLLER_IP

# Put the mac-k3d CLI on PATH (not the iCode release)
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/bin"

# Download the mac-k3d CLI (change tag/arch if needed)
curl -fsSL -o /tmp/mac-k3d \
  "https://github.com/Toby-Yu/mac-k3d/releases/download/v0.5.2/mac-k3d-linux-x86_64"
chmod +x /tmp/mac-k3d
cp /tmp/mac-k3d "$HOME/.local/bin/mac-k3d"

# First-run wizard: role CI controller, Jenkins 17070 (a controller is not asked about Harbor)
# When asked for CI secrets, enter the DeepSeek key as credential deepseek-api-key
mac-k3d setup -c ~/.config/mac-k3d/config.yaml

# Confirm Jenkins and the eval jobs on this VM
JENKINS_URL=http://127.0.0.1:17070 ./scripts/env_set_up/02_check_controller.sh
```

If you already cloned this repo on the VM, run `02_check` from that checkout. After upgrading the binary, refresh the job XML:

```bash
# Re-apply Jenkins jobs without re-entering secrets (keeps existing credential binds)
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
mac-k3d config -c ~/.config/mac-k3d/config.yaml --skip-secrets
```

Open `http://CONTROLLER_IP:17070` (or `http://127.0.0.1:17070` on that VM). User **admin**. Password from `mac-k3d config --show-jenkins` on the controller. Create an **API token** (admin → Configure → API Token). Copy the **secret**, not the token name.

---

## 2. Create a worker on a new Mac or Linux

```bash
# On the worker: mac-k3d CLI on PATH (not the iCode release)
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/bin"
# Linux x86_64 example — pick darwin-aarch64 / linux-aarch64 as needed
curl -fsSL -o /tmp/mac-k3d \
  "https://github.com/Toby-Yu/mac-k3d/releases/download/v0.5.2/mac-k3d-linux-x86_64"
chmod +x /tmp/mac-k3d
cp /tmp/mac-k3d "$HOME/.local/bin/mac-k3d"
mac-k3d --help   # must list setup and eval

# Worker wizard. Enter keeps the printed default, or type http://CONTROLLER_IP:17070
# Type http://<new-ip>:17070 if you created another controller
# Docker / git: Install if not found. Java and Harbor are not asked: setup uses or installs
# Java 21+ (the controller's Java) and the pinned Harbor
# API user: admin   API token: the secret from step 1
#   (or press Enter to skip; worker.yaml keeps api_user: '' and api_token: '' to fill in later)
# Never run: mac-k3d start -c worker.yaml
mac-k3d setup -c ~/.config/mac-k3d/worker.yaml

# Skipped the token? Fill api_user / api_token in worker.yaml (nano), then register:
# nano ~/.config/mac-k3d/worker.yaml
# Agent refresh without re-wizard also extracts ~/.local/share/mac-k3d/pipeline
# Does not overwrite an iCode drop (icode or icode-*-full-*) in that folder
mac-k3d config -c ~/.config/mac-k3d/worker.yaml
```

To copy a working controller or worker YAML onto another machine (same pipeline, different host or `jenkins_job` defaults), export on the source host and import on the dest. Secrets are stripped; import only writes the file. Full flow, DeepSWE first→second question, and why `config --skip-secrets` does not put keys in the YAML: [export-import.md](export-import.md).

```bash
# Source host: sanitized copy (api_token blanked to '', no credentials.pending.yaml)
mac-k3d export -c ~/.config/mac-k3d/config.yaml -o /tmp/controller.yaml
mac-k3d export -c ~/.config/mac-k3d/worker.yaml -o /tmp/worker.yaml
# Optional: edit jenkins_job.default_task / labels / controller_url in those files

# Dest host: write only, then setup or config as usual
mac-k3d import /tmp/controller.yaml
mac-k3d import /tmp/worker.yaml -c ~/.config/mac-k3d/worker.yaml
# Overwrite an existing dest file:
# mac-k3d import /tmp/worker.yaml -c ~/.config/mac-k3d/worker.yaml --force
```

Linux without sudo stops before installing Docker and prints the root commands; after an administrator runs them, re-run `setup` and choose **Use existing config**. As **root**, Docker is ready without a logout. As a normal user, log out/in after the `docker` group is added, then re-run `setup`. macOS: open **Docker Desktop** until it is idle.

Worker tools and versions (all in [dependencies.md](dependencies.md)): Docker with compose and buildx, Java 21 or newer (the controller image's Java; Linux `openjdk-21-jre-headless`, macOS `temurin@21`), git, python3 3.11+, bash 4.4+, Harbor 0.22.0. On a Mac, setup installs Java, bash and python with Homebrew as you (no root). macOS is supported by the code and CI, not yet lab-tested; the Mac commands are the same as above with the `mac-k3d-darwin-aarch64` (or `-x86_64`) asset.

```bash
# Optional: confirm this PC can reach cloud Jenkins and the agent unit is up
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
JENKINS_URL=http://CONTROLLER_IP:17070 \
  bash -lc 'echo "check Jenkins login"; curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" "$JENKINS_URL/login"'
```

In Jenkins: **Manage Jenkins → Nodes**. This machine must be **online** with label **`lolbench`**.

---

## 3. Provide iCode (after the node is Online, before eval)

Details: [icode-harness-inputs.md](icode-harness-inputs.md). Both methods work for DeepSWE and LoLBench.

1. **Release binary (typical)** — download `icode-<os>-<arch>-full-vX.Y.Z`. **Jenkins:** Build with Parameters → `ICODE_MODE=release` → upload `ICODE_RELEASE_FILE` (the original `*-full-*` name is lost; `tasks/icode` uses gzip/tar magic or copies a standalone binary as `icode`). **Local `--stage` / `--local`:** copy to `~/.local/share/mac-k3d/` or `mac-k3d set --icode-release /path/to/that-drop`. This is **not** a git clone of GitHub Release assets.
2. **Git clone** — `ICODE_MODE=git` plus URL + `ICODE_GIT_REF` + `ICODE_GIT_REF_KIND` (`branch` / `tag` / `commit` / `pr`). A tag checkout is a git tag, not a downloaded zip. Kind `pr` takes the pull-request number and checks out that tip. Report field `icode_git` records the resolved SHA. The clone is under the eval workdir, not a permanent developer tree.

```bash
# Local only (not Jenkins): discover under the worker share
mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/share/mac-k3d"
# Browser often saves this with no .tar.gz — that is OK:
cp /path/to/icode-linux-x86_64-full-v0.1.41 "$HOME/.local/share/mac-k3d/"
```

- A `*.tar.gz` / `*.tgz` or unpacked `*-full-*` **folder** must contain a file named `icode`.
- Do **not** copy `.venv/bin/icode` (tiny Python wrapper) into the drop folder. Do **not** put iCode inside `pipeline/`.

```bash
# Persist the binary drop path (once)
mac-k3d set --icode-release /path/to/icode-linux-x86_64-full-v0.1.41

# Git tag (clone, not Release assets)
mac-k3d eval --stage tasks --icode-mode git \
  --icode-git-url https://github.com/ORG/icode.git \
  --icode-git-ref v0.1.41 --icode-git-ref-kind tag
```

Extract the pipeline on the worker (`mac-k3d config -c worker.yaml`, or any `mac-k3d eval --stage …`) so `pipeline/lib/icode_input.sh` is present.

---

## 4. Run evaluation (N=1)

### Jenkins UI (recommended)

1. Open `http://CONTROLLER_IP:17070` → job **`<benchmark>_one_task`** for a first run (all Harbor + iCode). Do not flip `BENCHMARK` across jobs. For more than one question use `<benchmark>_some_task`, and for the whole suite `<benchmark>_full_suite_task`.
2. **Build with Parameters**. Each job lists only what its shape needs; `HARNESS`, `LLM` and `BENCHMARK` are always first so the build says what it evaluates, and the build is named `#<n> <harness>/<model>/<benchmark>`:

| Field | Jobs | Value |
|-------|------|--------|
| HARNESS / LLM / BENCHMARK | all | `icode` / `deepseek` / `deepswe`, `lolbench` or `swebenchpro` (fixed on that job) |
| TASK | `_one_task` | One question id. Empty runs the first sorted id. LoLBench default `ruff_1` |
| TASKS | `_some_task` | Comma-separated ids. Wins over N_TASKS. Example: `ruff_1,fastapi_1` |
| N_TASKS | `_some_task` | Used only when TASKS is empty: first N sorted ids. Full suite: DeepSWE `113`, LoLBench `20`, SWE-bench Pro `731` |
| N_ROLLOUTS | all | Attempts per question. `1` on `_one_task` (a smoke run), `4` on the others |
| ICODE_MODE | `_one_task` | Choose `release` (upload a drop) or `git` (clone URL + ref). Fill only the fields for that choice; leave the other group as it is. Shards of `_some_task` / `_full_suite_task` always use `git` |
| ICODE_RELEASE_FILE | `_one_task` | **release:** choose the `icode` / `icode-*-full-*` drop here. **git:** do not choose a file; leave this control as it is. |
| ICODE_GIT_URL | all | **git:** https URL on github.com or gitcode.com. **release:** leave it as it is. |
| ICODE_GIT_REF | all | **git:** branch name, tag, commit SHA, or pull-request number when KIND is `pr`. **release:** leave it as it is. |
| ICODE_GIT_REF_KIND | all | **git:** pick `branch`, `tag`, `commit`, or `pr` (no auto). **release:** leave it as it is. |
| DEEPSEEK_MODEL | all | `deepseek-flash` (catalog default; or `deepseek-v4-pro`). iCode sends this id to `https://api.deepseek.com/v1` with provider `DeepSeek` and reasoning effort `high` |

A build locks every core of the worker it lands on, and Harbor sizes its slots from them ([optimization.md](optimization.md)). `AGENT_LABEL`, pins, canary and `SHARD_SIZE` are developer parameters: they show only when the controller has `jenkins_job.ui_profile: developer`, and otherwise keep their config defaults. The developer page is this same table followed by those extras, each labelled `Developer (testing):`. The pipeline itself is not a parameter: each worker runs the one built into its installed `mac-k3d`, and `artifact.json` names that commit. See [workflow.md](workflow.md#development-loop-commit-push-redeploy) and [commands.md](commands.md#jenkins-job-parameters).

Git-mode CI: set `ICODE_MODE=git`, fill `ICODE_GIT_URL` / `ICODE_GIT_REF` / `ICODE_GIT_REF_KIND`. The archived JSON includes `icode_git` (resolved SHA + subject). Full split: [icode-harness-inputs.md](icode-harness-inputs.md).

Release-mode CI: **upload** `ICODE_RELEASE_FILE` in this UI. `mac-k3d eval --job` cannot attach a file.

3. Click **Build**. Console must say `Running on <this-worker-name>`. The build is allowed **96 hours**. Re-run `mac-k3d config` on the controller so the Jenkins job picks up that limit; an already installed job still has the old cap.
4. Download **Build Artifacts** → `eval-runs/output/<benchmark>/jenkins-<build>-<UTC>/artifact.json`, plus `summary.md` and `report.html` in that same folder. Token totals are input, output, and the sum.
   The Archive stage adds `cost-token-report.md` to that folder and keeps a compressed copy at `$WORKSPACE/mac-k3d-pipeline/output/<benchmark>/jenkins-<build>-<UTC>.tar.gz`, kept across builds (override with `MAC_K3D_OUTPUT_ROOT`). The workspace copy Jenkins shows is still the loose folder at `$HOME/jenkins-agent/workspace/<job>/eval-runs/output/` (or `{remote_fs}/workspace/<job>/eval-runs/output/` if `jenkins_agent.remote_fs` was changed).
   The same `.tar.gz` is also under **Build Artifacts** as `mac-k3d-pipeline/output/<benchmark>/jenkins-<build>-<UTC>.tar.gz`, so anyone who can open the build can download the whole run: the report plus each attempt's patches, masked transcripts, `trial.log` and anti-cheat verdicts. `tar -xzf jenkins-<build>-<UTC>.tar.gz` recreates the run folder. A `some_task` or `full_suite_task` build offers one combined `backup/<benchmark>/<RUN_GROUP>.tar.gz` for all its shards instead.

### CLI from any machine with the API token (queues Jenkins; no `--local`)

The same three jobs, with the same fields as the table above. Only the fields you pass are sent; the rest keep the job's defaults, as pressing **Build** with the form untouched does. Uses `jenkins_agent` from the loaded config, else `~/.config/mac-k3d/worker.yaml`. Harbor does not run in this shell: the command prints the build URL to watch.

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
# Check what would be sent; nothing is queued:
mac-k3d eval --job some --tasks ruff_1,fastapi_1 --benchmark lolbench --n-rollouts 1 --dry-run
# One question, git mode:
mac-k3d eval --job one --task abs-module-cache-flags --icode-mode git \
  --icode-git-url https://github.com/ORG/icode.git --icode-git-ref main --icode-git-ref-kind branch
# A list, or the whole suite:
mac-k3d eval --job some --tasks a,b,c --n-rollouts 4
mac-k3d eval --job full
# Developer fields go through --param (or the developer page):
mac-k3d eval --job some --tasks a,b --shard-size 1 --param CANARY=on
# Release mode: open the job page and upload ICODE_RELEASE_FILE; the CLI cannot attach a file.
```

All flags and what each job refuses: [commands.md](commands.md#queue-a-jenkins-job-from-the-cli). `--yes` without `--local` is the same as `--job one`.

Expect: build **SUCCESS**, artifact present. `pass@1` may be `0.0` on N=1 — that is a task result, not a setup failure. Missing F2P/P2P rates are `null`, not empty test-name lists.

```bash
# Optional: schema check on the downloaded JSON (from a checkout or extracted pipeline)
./pipeline/tools/check_report.sh /path/to/artifact.json
```

---

## 5. Developer only (this git checkout)

```bash
# Every phase locally, without Jenkins. Needs .env (gitignored), not for workers.
cd /path/to/mac-k3d
cp .env.example .env
chmod 600 .env
# put DEEPSEEK_API_KEY and DEEPSEEK_MODEL=deepseek-v4-pro in .env
# catalog also allows DEEPSEEK_MODEL=deepseek-flash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
mac-k3d eval --local --benchmark deepswe --n-tasks 1 --icode-mode binary
# mac-k3d eval --local --benchmark lolbench --task ruff_1 --icode-mode binary
# All three benchmarks use Harbor in the evaluate phase; the tasks phase resolves the iCode drop for the bind-mount
# One phase at a time: mac-k3d eval --stage env|tasks|evaluate|anticheat|score|report|archive
# or ICODE_MODE=git to clone from GitHub/GitCode
```

## Failures

| Symptom | What to do |
|---------|------------|
| Waiting for executor | Worker node offline; do not `start -c worker.yaml` |
| Node offline, agent log `UnsupportedClassVersionError` (class file 65 vs 61) or "Connection was broken" | The worker's Java is older than the controller's Java 21 (`JAVA_MAJOR`). Run `mac-k3d setup -c ~/.config/mac-k3d/worker.yaml`, choose **Use existing config**: it switches to an installed Java 21 or installs one (without sudo it prints `apt-get install -y openjdk-21-jre-headless` for an administrator). `mac-k3d config` then shows `java 21: ok` |
| `bash … is older than 4.4` | macOS `/bin/bash` 3.2. `brew install bash` (setup does it); the agent PATH puts `/opt/homebrew/bin` first |
| `python3 … is older than 3.11` | macOS `/usr/bin/python3` 3.9: `brew install python` (setup does it). Linux: python3 3.11+ ahead of `/usr/bin` on PATH |
| `pipeline/stages/run_all.sh` missing | Worker: `mac-k3d config -c worker.yaml` (extracts) **or** `mac-k3d eval --stage env` |
| iCode not found | Jenkins release: upload `ICODE_RELEASE_FILE`. Local: drop official `icode-*-full-*` or a file named `icode` in `~/.local/share/mac-k3d/` (see §3), or use `ICODE_MODE=git`. All three benchmarks bind-mount that tree at `/opt/icode-host`. |
| `cannot remove leftover … icode-src` | Old pipeline on the worker. Rebuild/install CLI, then `mac-k3d eval --stage env` (or `config -c worker.yaml`) so `~/.local/share/mac-k3d/pipeline` has `icode_force_rm`. Do not `sudo rm` as a routine step. |
| First LoLBench image is slow | Expected: the `env` phase installs the pinned Harbor and `docker buildx` if missing. Hub `smartdub26/lolbench` tags are **linux/arm64**. On x86_64, `tasks/images` runs `docker build --progress=plain` once (not Harbor `--force-build`, which hangs after the image is tagged). A local tag of the other architecture (for example from an earlier `docker pull`) is rebuilt the same way: iCode's x86-64 runtime cannot start in an emulated arm64 image (`python3.13: not found`). |
| `WARNING: egress via … has MTU …`, or every HTTPS call from a container times out (canary `model_api` `curl exit 28`) | A VPN tunnel (for example Surfshark WireGuard, MTU 1280) is smaller than Docker's 1500-byte bridge, so TLS replies are dropped. Disconnect the VPN, or add `"mtu": 1280` and `"default-network-opts": {"bridge": {"com.docker.network.driver.mtu": "1280"}}` to `/etc/docker/daemon.json` and restart Docker. |
| `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY missing` on Jenkins | Add credential `deepseek-api-key` on the **controller** |
| `--stage p0 is gone` | Phases replaced the old stage names; use the phase the message names ([pipeline.md](pipeline.md#old-stage-names)) |
| `no config at …; run mac-k3d setup -c … first` | The `-c` path does not exist (check the user name in the path); run `setup` with it first |
| `Left jenkins_agent.api_user / api_token empty` | Fill both in `worker.yaml`, then `mac-k3d config -c worker.yaml` |
| Disk/RAM preflight | Free space (`docker system df`); keep `N_TASKS=1` |
| `--yes` ran a local eval | Old CLI; install v0.5.2+ |
| Job still `deepseek-chat` or Toby paths | Controller: install new binary, `config --skip-secrets` |

E8 (N>1) is optional after N=1 is green. Lab operator notes: [cloud-eval-runbook.md](testing/cloud-eval-runbook.md).
