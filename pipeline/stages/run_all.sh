# One evaluation build, as seven phases. Each phase is a Jenkins stage and a
# script next to this one (<phase>.sh) that runs its steps (<phase>/<step>.sh):
#
#   env        bare-metal checks: host, compose, pinned Harbor, model API
#   tasks      per-task setup and checks: benchmark, selection, iCode, isolation
#   evaluate   canary + one `harbor run`        (the only phase under the CPU lock)
#   anticheat  post-Harbor receipts and verdicts
#   score      F2P/P2P per rollout
#   report     artifact.json, summary.md, report.html
#   archive    cost/token analysis, backup, tar.gz
#
# MAC_K3D_PHASE=<phase> runs one phase (Jenkins runs them as separate stages);
# all, the default, runs every phase in order. State lives under $WORKDIR, so
# the phases need not share a shell. With CANARY=only the build stops after
# evaluate: there are no rollouts to judge.
