#   --controller HOST   install, then `mac-k3d config --skip-secrets` (rewrites the jobs)

# Each worker's Jenkins builds run the pipeline embedded in its installed binary,
# so this is the only step between a pushed commit and a build that runs it.
# SSH asks each host's password once. Every host must end on this build's version.
